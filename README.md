## Description

_\<For this assignment we had to create 2 different equations and make sure they produce the required outcome. The other assignment was to debug code that was pre-written.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<In these assignments I learned a lot about how specific you need to be when dealing with a computer. I had to start over with the first assignment, and had to make multiple attempts at the second and third assignments to get them right.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
